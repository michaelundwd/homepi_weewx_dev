This records notes about updates to Belchertown 1.3

22nd April 2024
===============
PR #939
https://github.com/poblabs/weewx-belchertown/pull/939/commits

This changes the Aeris current conditions endpoint to use observations and removes the METAR configuration
This means that the current conditions on the lordshipweather would relate to the weather station values, not those of the nearest METAR place.

There are changes to ReadMe.md, belchertown.py, install.py, belchertown.js.tmpl and skin.configuration. Of these the significant ones are to belchertown.py and belchertown.js.tmpl

This looks like a good improvement and I could just copy the changes across and update manually.  There are three options
1 Make the changes manually to cover just these changes, as there are other development changes I have not implemented
2 Wait until there is a new release with it properly implemented
3 Wait until the PR is accepted and then use the  github facilities to download and modify manually

In the end, I made the #939 changes manually, leaving the other changes that have been made to another date.
The previous working versions of belchertown.py and belchertown.js.tmpl were copied with a .ok suffix in case of problems
The two files were loaded into D:\OneDrive\Documents\Computing\GitHub\homepi_weewx_dev\PR#939 and copied from there

It seemed to work, but there is no obvious way of knowing other than by comparing with garagepi version for a difference in conditions at Luton Airport and pws_Letchworth as Aeris knows lordshipweather.uk.

=============
Note garagepi has been superseded by zeropi as the operational weewx system, and been retired as sparepi.
